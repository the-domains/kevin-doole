Funny to read Mike Cohn's article, _[Advice on How to Split Reporting User Stories][0]_, now, after flying solo on a vast reporting project for slightly too long.

After estimating and re-estimating the same story each sprint, we realized that we were being crazy trying get a project done by having one developer toil away on what was clearly an epic. It's embarrassing to admit that that's what we were doing, but in the moment it feels completely natural to work that way.

The critical moment is the first planning meeting in which an epic manages to sneak into a sprint. If nobody notices it, or if someone notices it but thinks, "Bah, that _seems_ like an epic, but I bet it'll be fine," and the team estimates it and moves on, the story ends up building momentum. 

Given the story made it into a sprint one week, the following week, when the epic is not yet finished, the chances are decent that the same epic will again enter a new sprint. How long the undead epic continues to survive in the sprint backlog depends on the maturity of the team. **Every week is an opportunity to find and kill epics**. The moral here: if you notice that a story seems epic, say something.

In hindsight, if I were starting this project again from the top, I would certainly try what Cohn recommends, delivering a version "that works fully but only fills in one portion of the eventually complete report." 

Once you break the story into pieces, the product owner then has the opportunity to prioritize all the little pieces of the report however they like. And then the product owner gets to see valuable data asap. It seems more than likely that the product owner, with access to valuable new data, will then discover features that are more valuable than the rest of the reports. Rather than spending weeks on a series of lower-priority reports, the team can then switch off to high-value features.
