These days I spend the vast majority of my time writing the code that makes websites work. Product people work with designers, then hand off user stories to my team. We then pull details out of the user stories and teach computers how to make websites out of them. 

Before that, I spent the vast majority of my time talking to the people that use websites. I interviewed business people who were in charge of some specific websites. I also interviewed the people who used those websites. My goal was to find the details that fit in the common ground between what the business needed and what the users wanted. I would take my findings to designers and developers, and we would figure out what to do next. 

For years now, I've teetered between these two positions, not ever able to come to any kind of conclusion about what I actually enjoy. Maybe it's the teetering between perspectives that keeps me interested? Or maybe I just get bored. In any case, this is the perspective I bring to the content that I hope to publish on this website, semi-regularly. I've never hit that goal in the past, but let's see what happens!
